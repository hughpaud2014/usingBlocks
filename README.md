Java Educational

Java allows two or more statements to be grouped into blocks of code, also called code blocks. 
This is done by enclosing the statements between opening and closing curly braces.

This sample program is a brief overview on the code block design and will be very similar in some testing techniques.

BlockTest is for education purpose only as many of the public programs feel free to use code for review and understanding.
